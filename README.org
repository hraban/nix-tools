* Hraban’s Misc Nix Tools

Various Nix utility scripts for my nix computers.

This is a sandbox for personal stuff, I make zero guarantees about any API or anything. I will try not to force push any existing commits, so if you want to use something, pin the specific revision in your flake’s inputs and you should be fine.

* Battery Control for Mac (Intel and Apple Sillicon)

Use the =battery-control= nix-darwin module to control the maximum charge of
your battery.

Example:

#+begin_src nix
{
  inputs = {
    nix-tools.url = "github:hraban/nix-tools";
  };

  outputs = {
    nix-darwin
  , nix-tools
  , ...
  }: {
    darwinConfigurations = {
      MyHost = nix-darwin.lib.darwinSystem {
        # ...

        modules = [
          # Load the module here
          nix-tools.darwinModules.default

          # Now you can configure the actual module:
          ({ pkgs, ... }: {
            battery-control = {
              # Use a clamping service to automatically turn charging...
              clamp-service = {
                enable = true;
                min = 10; # ON, when charge drops below this level
                max = 30; # OFF when charge rises above this level
                # "Charging off" means "maintain current level using power
                # supply", which is what you normally experience at 100%.
              };
              # Enable an xbar plugin to control the battery.  Provides a binary
              # ON/OFF switch for charging.  Requires xbar installed, of course,
              # but also home-manager.
              xbar-plugin.enable = true;
            };
          })
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
#+end_src
